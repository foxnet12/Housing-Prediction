#                                       Housing Prediction Using Regression

## Objective: Every day, numerous homes are purchased. Buyers often ponder questions such as: What is the true value of this house? Am I being charged a reasonable price?

## Work steps:

1. Import pandas, train_test_split, Random Forest Regressor, and Mean absolute error algorithms including the data sets.
2. Combine the files.
3. Filling the missing values.
4. Split the combined file.
5. Encoding categorical variables
6.  Split the df1_encoded into features and target variable.
7.  Model Random Forest Regressor.
8.  Mean absolute error.
9.  The result is 0.4 percent error.
